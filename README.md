# ImagePacker

This is a simple python script to extract and repack custom image files. An example of usage of this script is to pack/unpack images for the PS2 version of Fate/Stay Night Realta Nua.
They are extracted in iif file format so Ifcaro's PS2ImageViewer is required to open and convert the images. It can be downloaded here http://foro.ifcaro.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=5
