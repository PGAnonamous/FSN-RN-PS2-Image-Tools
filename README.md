# ImagePacker

This is a simple python script to extract and repack the image files for the PS2 Fate/Stay Night Realta Nua. They are in iif file format so Ifcaro's PS2ImageViewer is required to open and convert the images. It can be downloaded here http://foro.ifcaro.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=5

The example bmp's show what can be done utilizing the script.
